## motivation 
One day, while I was reading reviews on TakeApp, I noticed that sellers were complaining about the lack of a delivery management system.
This resonated with me because of the current situation in Zimbabwe, where small shop owners struggle to deliver their products efficiently to customers.
Another challenge is that buyers often need internet access, which can be limited in Zimbabwe. 

This inspired me to create software that allows people to track their orders directly on WhatsApp.
That's how Delivery Guy was born. However, before development began, I needed to find a client in the delivery business. We partnered with a client who believed in my vision, and that partnership is what helped Delivery Guy get to where it is today.

## System Design 
One Thing i have learnt from software engineering is that systems always change as long as it serves people of dynamic needs 
In my case i started with orders the system was more of order management by then it was called Delivery Express , but it 
Evolved to Delivery Guy Below is a basic Schematic Diagram we used to boot Strap the building of the system .
